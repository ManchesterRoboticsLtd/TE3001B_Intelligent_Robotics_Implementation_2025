# TE3001B: Intelligent Robotics Implementation 2025

  ## Introduction
* This course, developed by Manchester Robotics Ltd. (MCR2), aims to provide professors with different training sessions to build their insight on using ROS to control and simulate a robotic manipulator. 
* This course is divided into five sessions, carefully designed for the user to learn about the different ROS tools to simulate and control a robotic manipulator. 
* This course introduces different challenges to make the professors aware of the problems faced while implementing advanced intelligent algorithms in robotics.
